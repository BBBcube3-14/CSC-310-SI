Create  a program using ANY lnaguage (Preferrably c, c++, javascript)
Compare to several DNA sequences to the following rules:

Every two letters will be a pair.
E.G.
    ATGC
    A and T are a pair
    G and C are a pair

Each sequence will be comprised of 20 characters A, C, G, and T.

Covid begins with an A, and the flu starts with a T.

Covid ends with C, and the flu ends with A.


Reminder valid pairs: AT, TA, GC, and CG.

    If you run into a case such as
    ACta
    A and C can not pair so output that the sequence is invalid.


You will test a sequence against the following sequences:
    Covid:   ATATCGTAATGCCGATTAGC 
    Flu:     TACGTAATATTAGCGCTATA
    Invalid: ATcaTATACGATagTAGCTA



If the sequence is valid, print "Valid Sequence".
Otherwise print, "Invalid Sequence"
